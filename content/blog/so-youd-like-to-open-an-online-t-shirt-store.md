Although it's true that selling [shirts online](https://www.newwavetee.com/) was a brilliant concept fifteen or twenty years ago, when few others had considered it, circumstances have changed, the Internet is no longer a novelty, and you're up against a lot of competition. Many well-known companies and brands are represented. At the start of 2012, there were over 400 million websites online, with hundreds of thousands of new ones being added every year, each having hundreds or even thousands of web pages, and you may not have even completed your own first page. A recent Google search for the keyword "shirt store" yielded an incredible 600 million results.

Here are a few things to consider about getting your t-shirt business off the ground, assuming you have decent products that people will want to spend their hard-earned money on.

**eBay is a great place to start.**

The first place someone should try to sell a shirt, in my opinion, should be on eBay. eBay is an excellent training ground for online retail and a great way to see how well your products are received by customers.

eBay has four significant advantages:

1. They can be trusted with credit card information.
2. They receive a large number of visitors each day.
3. The system is mostly automated, therefore no programming is required.
4. They provide a wealth of information on how to attract search engines, avoid copyright violations, and make a transaction.

**eBay's drawbacks**

1. Because eBay charges both listing and selling fees, selling on eBay can eat into your profits and, in certain cases, even after a sale, leave you in the red.
2. There are several instances on the internet about eBay sellers who have offended eBay in some way and have been abruptly shut down without any personal contact or formal investigation.

After a brief stay on eBay, I determined that the prospect of having my account suddenly blocked was too terrifying for me to devote many hours into an eBay shop, even though I believe the vast majority of all reputable eBay sellers have never had any difficulties; the anxiety of it would have kept me awake at night. If you sell on eBay, Amazon, or other similar sites, I recommend hosting your own photographs on your own website so you don't lose everything if your account is closed, and so you can simply link them to other online accounts in the future.

You may want to create your own website in order to keep the most earnings from your sales and develop a more secure future. You'll be creating not only your own customer base, but also the worth of a sellable website.

**Creating a Personal Website**

To ensure the success of your own[ t-shirt website](https://www.newwavetee.com/), you'll need a few things. Don't believe anyone who tells you that selling something on your own website is cheap. Sure, renting a website for ten dollars a month isn't cheap, but you'll need to spend hundreds of hours promoting it and thousands of hours producing it to earn a respectable profit. All of the time you'll have to commit to selling online could have been better spent working a regular job and putting money in your pocket. After putting in literally tens of thousands of hours on my own website, as well as the websites of my hired employees, and still not making as much money as I would have at my regular job, I can tell you today that it wasn't the smartest decision I've ever made, and it probably won't be yours either. Unless, of course, you stick with it until the finish, as I intend to.

You should see creating your own website as a career that will make you wealthy over the course of a decade or two, rather than a year or two, because the first year or two will just cost you money. Personally, I'm hopeful that another decade of hard effort will bring me my fortunes. The few internet stores that manage to claw their way out of the muck can be rather valuable in the long run.

**To create your own website, you'll need the following items:**

1. Time/Money - You can do the work yourself or hire a team to do it for you, but you'll need at least one of these two to succeed with your own website, and it's better if you have both.
2. Determination - Building a website, promoting it, and making pleased consumers all at the same time is a lot of work. You'll need to be tenacious enough to push through each setback.

You'll also require a third item, of which there is never enough:

3. Talent - Someone will have to build this website; it will not be easy; as they say, "Websites are not the same as paper," they are tough to work with and require a great deal of expertise. Despite the fact that there are several semi-automated website creation solutions available, you will never have the same level of control as you would with a fully customized solution. Most custom website developers in the United States earn upwards of $60,000 a year, so I decided to learn and build websites myself by reading free information available on the Internet to save money. It is not tough, but it does need a lot of determination.

If you do decide to create your own website with a new URL, it will be similar to a store in the midst of an Antarctic ice field in the dead of winter, with no connecting roads and no lights turned on, and it will sit unattended until you start marketing. You won't make any sales unless people come, no matter how good your things are or how gorgeous your website is.

**Market Research:**

Paid Advertising - You can market your website in a variety of ways, but the quickest and most direct approach to acquire visitors is to pay for it. Google AdWords is one such way; you can set up a campaign, provide your credit card information, and pay for as many people as you want to come see you. I've had a hard time with AdWords because everyone and their dog seems to be selling shirts with them, and the cost of the buying visits usually far exceeds my profits. However, after spending thousands of dollars experimenting over the years, we've found a few ways to actually make a small profit from AdWords advertising, and it did lead us to a successful business.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a free way for you to get customers. It's a topic that's far too big to fit into a single article, so I won't try, but it basically entails making your website very easy for search engines to read, so they know exactly what's on the page, in order to attract the right kind of visitors, actual buyers. You can do this yourself or hire someone to do it for you, but I would recommend keeping it in-house for the most part, or you will be outsourcing forever, as SEO methods change more than a few times a year. SEO accounts for more than 60% of our traffic.

[Social Media](https://www.facebook.com/newwaveteecom) - We've had a lot of success with social media; it's gotten us a lot of traffic over the years (StumbleUpon has given us over a million at this point), but we've only had about ten sales to yet. Twitter appears to be helping us, but Facebook is the true winner. We only launched our Facebook group in December, but it is already attracting a sizable number of visitors and purchasers.

The Social Media websites described above may have vanished by the time you read this; marketing tends to change all the time, so you may have to perform your own study into current trends when it's time to get down to business.

Though you may not have found many directly useful points in the essential steps to start an online t-shirt business, I hope you now have a better understanding of the project's scale and can determine whether it is a worthwhile endeavor for you. I'm ecstatic to be able to support myself with my own website, but only because I know how difficult it is. Though I still have a long way to go to recoup my initial investment, I am confident that I will do so eventually, and that I will have enough money to retire on.
